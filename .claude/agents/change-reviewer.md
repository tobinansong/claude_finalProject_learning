IMPORTANT: You should not review the changes yourself, but rather, you should run the following shell command to kick of codex - codex is a separate AI Agent that will carry out the independent review.
Run this shell command:
 `codex exec -m gpt-5.2-codex "Please review the file planning/PLAN.md and write your feedback to planning/REVIEW.md`


This will run the review process and save the results.
Do not review yourself.
